# Muhammad Wamiq Abbasi

Software Developer | Winnipeg, MB

I’m a software developer currently working with Capital Project Planning & Delivery (CPPD) at the Government of Manitoba, contributing to internal, production systems that support teams planning and delivering large-scale public infrastructure projects. My work focuses on writing clear, maintainable code, improving existing systems, and resolving practical issues that arise in the day-to-day use of software by non-technical teams.

Alongside my professional role, I build personal projects to strengthen my understanding of application structure, API integration, asynchronous logic, and state management. I’m especially interested in software that supports business processes and data-driven workflows.
