# Muhammad Wamiq Abbasi

Software Developer focused on building and maintaining production code that supports business-critical workflows. I currently work within Capital Project Planning & Delivery (CPPD) at the Government of Manitoba, where I design, implement, and refine internal software tools used by teams responsible for planning and delivering multi-million-dollar public infrastructure projects.

My work focuses on writing and maintaining logic-driven code, refactoring existing systems, and resolving reliability and integration issues in production environments. Within Capital Project Planning & Delivery (CPPD) at the Government of Manitoba, I contribute internal software solutions that support complex operational workflows used by teams delivering large-scale public infrastructure projects.

In parallel with my professional role, I actively build and maintain software projects that reflect product-oriented development, including REST API integration, asynchronous processing, state management, structured error handling, and modular application design. These projects help reinforce the same problem-solving and system-design skills required in service-based, SaaS environments.
